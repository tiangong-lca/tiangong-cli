# Runtime distribution

The CLI owns generic component installation and runtime identity for workspace #980/W07. Foundry owns its task state, profiles and product compatibility manifest. Skills carry the CLI-owned minimal bootstrap and a product-selected immutable lock. The CLI package has no static Foundry dependency, and installation never grants data permissions.

## Current public inspection surface

`tiangong-lca runtime describe --json` and `@tiangong-lca/cli/runtime` describe the current built CLI package through the same implementation. The public library exports `describeCliRuntime`, `assertCliRuntimeMatches`, schema identifiers, supported platform tuples and types. The package root and private runtime subpaths remain closed. This API was introduced by #274. Version 0.1.10 is the designated first public C1 package; callers must still verify registry availability, integrity and provenance before trusting that release.

Inspection creates no files, authenticates nowhere and makes no network request. Runtime commands bypass CWD `.env` loading. The CLI launcher rejects retired/unsupported OS/architecture tuples before loading user configuration. Source development describes its built distribution; installed execution needs no source tree or Git.

The descriptor schema is `tiangong-lca.cli-runtime-descriptor.v1`, published in `assets/runtime/cli-runtime-descriptor.schema.json`. It includes:

- exact package name/version, canonical root and package-manifest SHA-256;
- current Node version, canonical executable path, byte count and SHA-256;
- the OS/architecture tuple and shell-free executable plus launcher argv;
- the TIDAS schema root and asset inventory fingerprint;
- a sorted portable-path/size/SHA-256 inventory of `package.json`, `bin/**`, `dist/src/**` and `assets/**`, and its SHA-256.

Inventory identities hash compact UTF-8 `JSON.stringify` bytes in the declared field order. Paths in the inventory are package-relative and use `/`; machine-local roots and invocation paths are deliberately outside the content hash. Each file uses an open descriptor, bounded incremental hashing and before/after identity/size/modification checks. Descendant symlinks and non-regular files are rejected; a normal package-manager symlink at the package root is resolved once to its physical root. The inventory is bounded to 50,000 files and 2 GiB, with 512 MiB per file. Changed or incomplete observations fail instead of silently accepting cached metadata.

`assertCliRuntimeMatches` accepts a strict `tiangong-lca.cli-runtime-expectation.v1` from an **independent trusted release manifest**, then re-inspects the current installation and compares exact package version, platform, CLI content, Node version and Node content. Invalid expectations fail before package inspection. The returned observation is deeply immutable. Copying hashes out of the same untrusted observation does not establish release trust.

The descriptor's scope is `cli-package`. It does not attest transitive dependencies, a registry signature or the complete software component. The release-built component manifest must separately bind its frozen production dependency graph and every deployed file. The descriptor does not claim task authorization, data completion, OS minimum/ABI readiness or download qualification; the manager's host/manifest checks own those additional gates. Explicit Node 24.19+ within the stable Node 24 line and the four architecture tuples are the current package inspection admission boundaries.

## Manager and bootstrap contract

`runtime ensure/status`, immutable manifest validation, bounded downloads/archive handling, installation locks, atomic publication, verified warm/offline cache reuse, leases and owned-cache-only prune are required before W07 is complete. This inspection API alone is not a runtime manager or a zero-setup installer.

The compatibility manifest must bind exact component versions, archive/content digests, frozen production-lock identity, asset/protocol fingerprints and distinct workspace read/write schema-feature support. Unsupported host/ABI, unknown schemas, untrusted alternate sources, unsafe archive paths/links and mutable versions fail before installation. Existing task attempts and workspaces are never rewritten or reset by runtime operations.

POSIX/PowerShell bootstrap scripts are generic C1 release assets and require no Node/pnpm. Their adjacent skill-delivered `bootstrap-lock.json` separately binds script bytes, bootstrap protocol and the already published product manifest URL/digest. C1 scripts must not embed an unpublished F1 digest. Neither task input nor an environment variable can replace the trust anchor. Rosetta selection requires actual Apple Silicon hardware proof and must select native arm64; Intel Mac, Windows arm64 and Linux musl do not receive a fallback.

Full release qualification requires all four supported CI hosts, no-global-Node/pnpm copied bootstrap cases, interruption/concurrency/corruption tests, exact 100% source coverage and an independently verified public C1 package. Foundry F1/component/cold-start qualification follows in its owning repository and the workspace integration task. No local routine registry publish or new credential fallback is introduced.

## Managed components and execution

The merged #274 manager exposes `runtime ensure`, `status`, `prune`, `lease-release` and `exec`. They require an explicitly selected local manifest plus its independently trusted SHA-256. `status` is read-only; missing installations do not create a cache or access a registry. `ensure` installs only selected-host components. The manifest schema is `assets/runtime/runtime-manifest.schema.json`; status/prune/lease output uses `assets/runtime/runtime-command-result.schema.json`; the public parser additionally enforces cross-field identity, canonical file order/hash, path collisions, metadata references and read/write compatibility. Serialized objects are not verified manifests: the loader/byte verifier returns a branded immutable value.

A manifest binds product/version, bootstrap protocol, per-platform minimum OS release and glibc, workspace read/write schemas and features, components and declared launches. `os_release` uses the platform's `os.release()` version, not a marketing release name. Linux requires a present, compatible runtime glibc; the host collector projects only that diagnostic header and never serializes the report or its environment. A write-compatible schema/feature set must also be readable. Foundry must still check its own task schema and execution gates.

Every component binds a stable id/version/platform, immutable distribution URL, compressed byte count/SHA-256, complete sorted unpacked file inventory and its content digest, and inventory references to the frozen production lock, SBOM, license and provenance artifacts. These artifacts are release-produced evidence; the installer does not turn a self-written provenance JSON into cryptographic publication authority. The independent product-manifest trust anchor and release qualification remain mandatory.

The canonical `tar-gzip-ustar-v1` interchange has only regular files, declared 0644/0755 modes, UTF-8 portable paths, zero file padding and exactly two terminating blocks. There are no directory, symlink, hard-link, device, sparse, PAX or executable-install-script entries. Parents are created from the validated inventory. Builders materialize the production dependency graph first; pnpm's documented `nodeLinker: hoisted` supplies a symlinkless layout where appropriate. The release-side writer packages only explicit content-bound files, and tests also read its output with the OS tar implementation. Consumer extraction uses bounded Node gzip streams and the declared inventory, with no tar/package-manager/compiler dependency after bootstrap.

Download sources are HTTPS release assets on GitHub, versioned Node distributions or exact npm tarballs. Redirects are bounded and permit only those origins plus GitHub artifact delivery hosts; credentials and server error bodies are never forwarded or logged. The archive is incrementally hashed and must match exact size/SHA before decoding. Only classified connection, stream or transient HTTP reads may retry once. User cancellation and integrity failures do not replay. Failed cleanup may remove only the download file owned by that attempt; an existing destination is preserved.

The owned cache marker is `tiangong-lca.runtime-cache.v1`. Component directories are keyed by the complete canonical component description, so changed metadata cannot reuse a different installation. Each contains `root/` and a final receipt. Separate initialization/component/lease locks use the existing public batch run-lock owner. An installation is assembled privately, checked completely and atomically renamed; partial or corrupt published directories are not overwritten. Bootstrap may publish a full tree before Node can write its receipt, but adoption rechecks every inventory byte/mode and rejects extra files first.

Persistent leases pin exact component keys for an explicit non-secret id and owner. Changed owner/component sets require an explicit release, and malformed lease state blocks pruning. `prune --apply` removes only receipt-owned selected components with no active leases; source inputs, workspaces, account sessions and unknown data are outside its ownership. Cache, authentication and project/task lifecycles remain independent.

`exec` resolves only a manifest-declared executable/argv prefix, appends bounded application argv, rejects credential flags and requires an existing explicit work directory outside runtime/skill installation roots. It reuses CommandSpec, holds an execution lease and waits for child closure even after cancellation or output overflow. It never retries the application. Persistent task leases may coexist. Child environments contain essential platform paths only unless the trusted launch explicitly selects `cli-auth`, which forwards only the CLI's existing public/auth configuration and process-only access-token contract. Passwords, user API keys, `NODE_OPTIONS` and unrelated secrets are excluded. A child exit or an installed cache is not evidence of Foundry business completion.

The no-Node bootstrap implementations live in `scripts/bootstrap/tiangong-runtime-bootstrap.sh` and `.ps1`. They pin system tools, verify their own bytes against an adjacent `tiangong-lca.runtime-bootstrap-lock.v1`, select only the four supported tuples, verify the cached/downloaded manifest and complete base component, and start its Node/CLI with a cleared environment and exact argv. The source repository deliberately has no product `bootstrap-lock.json`: Skills creates that adjacent lock only after the F1 manifest and four base components exist, preventing a C1/F1 publication cycle. The 0.1.10 C1 package verifier closes the CLI-owned publication slice; public F1 product components, all-platform product cold starts, Skills locks and final integration remain downstream. The private live proof installs actual Node 24.19 and public CLI 0.1.9 production files from a verified local seed, invokes real account identity through that managed pair, checks offline reuse and lease/prune behavior, and preserves original inputs. It does not claim that a public runtime component has already been released.

## Bootstrap behavior

The POSIX script fixes its tool search path to system directories, disables curl configuration, permits HTTPS only, enforces declared download limits and verifies SHA-256 before archive use. It detects Linux glibc x64/arm64 and native macOS arm64. An x64 macOS process may choose arm64 only when both Apple Silicon capability and translated-process checks pass. Intel Mac, musl and unknown hosts fail before network or cache installation.

The PowerShell script uses the system `tar.exe`, `RuntimeInformation.OSArchitecture`, manual HTTPS redirects and bounded streaming. Windows arm64 fails before downloads. It checks archive names/types before full extraction, uses atomic cache marker and file locks, verifies all checksum entries, and launches through `ProcessStartInfo` with a cleared allowlisted environment and Windows argument quoting. Tests execute the POSIX source on this host and the Windows branch on Windows CI; both scripts have static no-eval/no-credential/no-execution-policy-bypass checks and source-copy byte equality.

The flattened `assets/runtime/runtime-bootstrap-lock.schema.json` is intentionally simple enough for POSIX extraction without Node or `jq`. It binds both script SHA-256 values, bootstrap protocol, product manifest URL/bytes/SHA, launch id, and each platform base component/archive/checksum/file-count/Node/CLI path. Scripts always read `bootstrap-lock.json` beside themselves; no flag, environment variable, task file or downloaded document may replace it. Existing verified base components and manifests support warm/offline launch with no curl call; component adoption remains subject to the Node manager's independent full manifest check before other components or applications run.
