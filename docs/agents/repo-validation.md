## Default Baseline

Unless the change is doc-only, the minimum local baseline is:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm test:package
pnpm build
```

For protected-branch parity, the authoritative full gate is:

```bash
pnpm prepush:gate
```

Review note, 2026-08-25: Issue #224 fixes local and CI proof to Node 24, pnpm 11.23.0, TypeScript 7.0.2, and type-aware Oxlint. `pnpm test:package` is mandatory: it rejects alternate or nested lockfiles, legacy TypeScript/ESLint bridges, active npm package-management commands, unpinned pnpm CI bootstrap, and development-tool leakage into the tarball; it also installs and executes the packed artifact through a package-manager-neutral consumer. The feature version remains 0.0.33, while a separate 0.1.0 release PR is recommended after merge and all gates pass.

Review note, 2026-08-25: SDK 0.2 build-plan proof covers exact canonical product/process/elementary taxonomy objects and the correct elementary output shape. Missing, empty, string-only, non-array, non-contiguous-level, missing-field, and arbitrary UUID/label classifications must fail; no test may bypass the production materializer with an injected passing schema.

Review note, 2026-08-25: Issue #226 is the dedicated 0.1.0 release for merged Issue #224 / PR #225. Release proof requires pre-mutation npm/tag absence, all four live CLI-version fixtures at 0.1.0, unchanged `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm test:package`, exact 100% coverage, audit, strict Docpact, the fresh four-platform matrix, AI Doc Lint, merge-triggered tag creation, native pnpm Trusted Publishing/provenance, and a fresh public-registry consumer before workspace integration. The CLI is intentionally bin-only: proof means an ESM host imports `@tiangong-lca/cli/bin/tiangong-lca.js`, a CJS host dynamically imports that same explicit launcher subpath, both call the exported launcher helpers, and `node_modules/.bin/tiangong-lca` preserves help/version/error behavior. Package-root `require('@tiangong-lca/cli')` and `import '@tiangong-lca/cli'` are not supported module APIs.

Review note, 2026-08-25: Issue #228 proof must cover safe malformed-project rejection before credential/session work, supported timeout bounds, all session/cache modes, stale or foreign cache binding, one 401/403 refresh only, redirect rejection, canonical user UUIDs, nonzero/malformed/non-JSON/`ok:false` responses, pre-read Content-Length and incremental stream byte caps, exact-key schema validation, canonical request/response/receipt hashes, observed/partial/intent-bound assertion modes, and absence of credentials, full email, token/path data, or their fingerprints from success and error output. The local production case command itself must perform the one clean build before its plain-Node parent starts, reject alternate entrypoints, prove one-read built buffers feed both hash and snapshot, bind source/generated-runtime/runner/entrypoint/lock hashes, exercise the default snapshot path on every platform, clean the snapshot before evidence publication, reject cleanup ambiguity without passed artifacts, force reauth with cache disabled, create a private cwd exclusively, persist no raw stdout/stderr, and perform no dataset mutation. POSIX permission bits and Windows inherited-parent ACL assumptions must be stated separately. Live execution remains a separate explicitly authorized local case; it is not added to CI secrets.

Review note, 2026-08-25: Issue #230 release proof requires pre-mutation 0.1.1 registry/tag absence, exactly four live version fixtures, strict Docpact, package/prepush/exact-coverage gates, and the exact matrix on both PR head and release merge. Published dependencies remain unchanged; the sole lock is regenerated only for exact dev-only `sigstore@5.0.0`. `.nvmrc`, engines, release detection, quality, tag, and publish jobs all use Node 24.19.0; macOS arm64, Ubuntu x64/arm64, and Windows x64 each assert actual platform/architecture. After native pnpm Trusted Publishing, `release:verify-published` must reject forged DSSE/type/predicate/certificate/identity/CT/Rekor evidence, bind optional registry `gitHead` and mandatory provenance `gitCommit`, verify registry signatures and downloaded tarball sha512, override both user/global config, require pnpm 11.23.0, scan dependency/optional/peer production branches, and exercise bin/ESM/CJS plus `auth identity-receipt --help`. The child finish continuation owns integration create/reuse and child completion; operators finish the returned integration task, not the child twice.

Review note, 2026-08-26: Issue #232 proof covers exact Foundry CommandSpec differential vectors; pre-aborted zero-spawn, synchronous adapter failure cleanup, timeout/abort race containment, and Node timer ceilings; all-item projection preflight; claim-time identity/content/policy/resource rechecks; stable identity-drift error/events for returned or thrown getter values; in-flight mutation drainage after both item drift and escaping `shouldStop` infrastructure failure; immediate fatal claim closure; deterministic first-error rejection after all workers settle; per-item resume triples; runtime exclusive-key validation and serialization; blocked-resource zero-worker scheduling with truthful claim/unclaimed order; FIFO successor exposure after stop; private min-heap structure and a 5,000-item near-linear operation bound; per-result resume stop; 64-worker resource ceiling; mutation retry rejection and readback-only recovery; timer-bounded read retry; monotonic awaited events; live-owner-scope-only reentrancy; detached nested scope drainage; completed-context rejection; same-directory cross-process exclusion across identities; internally derived ownership metadata; same-host stale recovery; spoof-resistant foreign/live lock preservation; and physical-lock-safe local handoff. Package proof runs the explicit launcher, CommandSpec, batch, and run-lock APIs from packed ESM/CJS hosts and compiles generated declarations with empty type roots. Dataset save-draft proof locks serial-prefix behavior, suffix concurrency/fatal stop, row order, and exact report bytes. Version stays 0.1.1 until separate release work.

Review note, 2026-08-26: Issue #233 adds move-only architecture characterization before decomposition, then requires the same behavior proof after every wave. The architecture suite locks the exact public runtime/type export sets, re-exported function/class object identities, generated declaration names, error own-key/message/code shapes, deterministic event/result JSON bytes, semantic module inventory, current shrink-only LOC ceilings, allowed dependency edges, forbidden upward imports, and zero SCCs. Final proof requires a facade of 62 lines, no internal module above 445 lines, unchanged packed ESM/CJS/TypeScript consumers, unchanged dataset save-draft dogfood, and exact 100% coverage for every new module.

Review note, 2026-08-26: Issue #236 starts with a failing exact-version contract, then requires pnpm 11.24.0 for manifest/engine resolution and the clean public-release consumer. Proof includes a pnpm 11.24.0 frozen install, zero lockfile diff after lockfile-only reconciliation, the 12/12 package suite, the complete pre-push gate with exact 100% coverage, strict Docpact, and the reusable macOS arm64, Ubuntu x64/arm64, and Windows x64 quality matrix. Node 24.19.0, TypeScript 7.0.2, package 0.1.1, dependencies, exports/runtime, tags, and publication state must not move.

Review note, 2026-08-26: Issue #237 release proof requires recorded pre-mutation npm 0.1.2 and `cli-v0.1.2` absence, a RED exact-version fixture commit before the package bump, exactly four live CLI-version fixtures at 0.1.2, and unchanged lock bytes/dependency graph/runtime/exports. Local proof uses Node 24.19.0, pnpm 11.24.0 frozen install, the 12/12 package suite, release-focused tests, the complete pre-push gate with exact 100% coverage, audit, and strict Docpact. Post-merge proof still requires the exact four-platform matrix, AI Doc Lint, merge-triggered tag, native pnpm Trusted Publishing/provenance, registry integrity/attestation, fresh credential-free ESM/CJS/TypeScript consumers, and exact release-merge workspace integration.

Review note, 2026-08-29: Issue #240 proof requires exact runtime object identity between the new public auth parser and its existing semantic owner, exact runtime/type exports, invalid-receipt fail-close, generated declarations, clean packed ESM/CJS/TS consumers, and continued rejection of package-root/internal deep imports. Existing auth behavior tests and the exact 100% gate remain authoritative; package version stays 0.1.2 until a separate patch release.

When command-surface, release-gate, or governed docs change, also run the repo-local documentation governance gate:

```bash
scripts/docpact validate-config --root . --strict
scripts/docpact lint --root . --base <base> --head <head> --mode enforce
```

Review note, 2026-06-04: dataset curation queue state changes are covered by focused `dataset-curation-queue` tests plus the unchanged TypeScript/build gate.

Historical npm-era review note (retired; do not use as current instructions), 2026-06-05: release 0.0.12 used the then-current proof contract: unpublished-version check, `npm run prepush:gate`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.

Historical npm-era review note (retired; do not use as current instructions), 2026-06-06: release 0.0.13 kept local validation separate from publication. Local proof was unpublished-version check, `npm run prepush:gate`, `npm pack --dry-run`, and docpact; publication happened only after the version-bump PR merged to upstream `main` and GitHub Actions ran the tag and publish workflows.

Review note, 2026-06-07: release 0.0.14 requires the same local proof plus focused dataset classification coverage for explicit missing location target creation. Publication remains PR merge to upstream `main`, tag workflow, and npm Trusted Publishing.

Review note, 2026-06-11: release 0.0.15 requires the same local proof plus focused dataset import-lca coverage for the tidas-tools 0.0.28 bundle-flag adaptation and disk-derived report fields. Publication remains PR merge to upstream `main`, tag workflow, and npm Trusted Publishing.

Review note, 2026-08-20: Issue #222 proof must cover binary-discovery precedence, the five supported release targets and Windows ARM64 rejection, compatible `0.2.x` patch versions, protocol/version/report/exit mismatch rejection, native runtime flag translation, cancellation exit 130, and absence of active Python/check-out discovery. Run the packaged SimaPro fixture through the checksum-verified v0.2.0 artifact with Python unavailable, inspect `pnpm --filter @tiangong-lca/cli --fail-if-no-match pack --dry-run` for the fixture, then run the complete `pnpm prepush:gate` and docpact gates.

Review note, 2026-07-30: Issue #214 proof must assert that identity preflight emits only `lexical_weight` plus `semantic_weight`, and that protected derivative reads/snapshots no longer require the retired lexical column. Focused identity-preflight and dataset-maintenance suites plus the exact-coverage pre-push gate remain mandatory.

Review note, 2026-08-07: database-engine Issue #422 proof must run `pnpm lint:data-api-consumers` and assert database commit `0a97cc761f8127ca379ab7d4df4395dab255707a`, migration head `20260807103000`, exact migration-tree/file hashes, the nine-table public allowlist, zero view consumers, the complete 16-RPC `api` inventory, and zero retired `public`/private-alias consumers. Tests must retain explicit relation/RPC profile headers, authenticated-only role and RLS boundaries, structured invalid/unmanifested/retired errors, GET/HEAD and manifest-read-RPC auth-refresh replay, mutation/unknown no-replay behavior, exact-count pagination, and existing protected-execution idempotency/audit regressions.

Review note, 2026-07-11: `dataset maintenance plan/apply/verify` adds focused proof for exact-row scope freezing, current-user RLS guards, immutable plan hashing, protected-row classification, full-plan drift preflight, approval-before-write, per-action logs, platform audit correlation, failure/resume behavior, and independent readback verification.

Review note, 2026-07-12: `merge-support-aliases` validation freezes and proves the reviewed BAFU owner-draft profile: required scope/plan `target_mode=owner_draft`, current-actor state-0 source/target support and parents, 25 time rows plus 27 length-time rows, exact factors, 20 plus 39 exchange rewrites, 309 unrelated exchanges preserved, one ordered `target_visibility=owner_draft` whole-plan RPC, immutable support/closure evidence, plan/batch audit-correlated replay, and fresh private-state readback. Public, foreign-owner, mixed-visibility, stale, recomputed, corrupted, or dimension-partial proofs must fail.

Review note, 2026-07-13: maintenance pagination proof now covers requested page sizes above a server cap, actual-length offset progression, exact `Content-Range` totals, strict ordered identities, aggregate entity counts, and fail-before-artifact/write behavior. Tests must not describe the resulting multi-request traversal as a transaction-level or MVCC snapshot.

Review note, 2026-07-14: `rebuild-derivatives` proof requires exactly one owner-draft state-0 process action with the exact `extracted_md` plus `embedding_ft` components, a plan-bound action-scoped database snapshot, guarded-RPC-only admission, idempotent request replay, and independent `pending`/`passed`/`failed` verification. Tests must reject any direct Edge/admin/raw queue/SQL/REST mutation fallback and must not treat `accepted`/`queued` as terminal completion.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Step 3 flow-identity tests must cover all 305 reviewed source decisions, one complete census with unaffected process payloads omitted from persisted capture, exactly one capture-attestation POST, permanent rejection of pre-Step2/224-row authority, equal-count semantic tamper rejection, exact five-field reference patches, collision preservation, pending/blocker/orphan closure, process-schema gates, database-owned derivative baselines, safe no-cycle request hashing, exact v2 response variants, serial next-ordinal execution, bounded scope reads, ambiguous-response zero-retry recovery, offline freeze/seal, and independent terminal readback. Runner tests must prove pending and failed derivative decisions make zero finalize calls, exact causal/current readiness makes one finalize call, and a post-read readiness race returning pending is never retried in the same invocation. A failed/stale derivative must stop without process replay; derivative-only compensation is not authorized without a separate plan, freeze, and exact approval.

Review note, 2026-07-17: Issue #157 COMMON proof additionally requires separate `passed` readback hashes/timestamps for both Issue #29 derivative prerequisites; HTTP-success `ok:false` coverage; exactly one fresh scope read after process rejection; and verifier `pending` only for exact `derivatives_pending`. Tests now also prove exact rotating-permit generation/invocation binding, zero bearer persistence, create-only local approval claims across output directories, replay-with-permit rejection, fresh exact recovery approval, and lost-preflight recovery through one exact read-only lookup with zero guarded writes. The database permit is the cross-machine authority and the local claim is defense in depth. Remaining release gates are merge, Preview validation, and coordinated DB/CLI publication.

Review note, 2026-07-15: protected alias-runner proof requires production-only environment binding, a complete pre-token account/support/50-target scan, three server-derived ordered gates inside the at-most-180-second window, immutable attempt evidence before exactly zero or one admission POST, and status-only recovery after every consumed or ambiguous attempt. Terminal verification must prove the exact 52-row/59-exchange/55-audit primary closure plus 23-flow + 27-process causal derivative closure and independent live RLS parity. Zero-child terminal `failed`/`indeterminate` is valid only with the exact not-started envelope; `completed` and `derivatives_pending` must reject that shape.

Review note, 2026-07-15: Issue #171 preparation proof additionally requires a strict freeze/seal split. Freeze tests must prove complete production owner-draft reads, stable exact 23-flow + 27-process capture, canonical toolchain evidence, zero preflight/gate/admission/mutation/approval artifacts, and rejection of public/foreign/stale/malformed closure. Seal tests must prove zero authentication/network/database calls, exact UTF-8 whitespace and final-newline preservation, explicit freeze-file/request/text/account/timestamp hashes, historical-plan rejection, immutable artifacts, and builder/parser/runner round-trip compatibility. The full `src/**/*.ts` coverage gate remains exactly 100%.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #175 proof requires a fixed five-second allowance only when server `completed_at` is slightly ahead of the client clock. Tests must accept the exact tolerance boundary, reject one millisecond beyond it, retain strict stale/reversed/over-180-second rejection, expose only token-free timing diagnostics, and prove parse failure still occurs before gate capture, submission-marker creation, or admission. Server-side expiry and one-shot enforcement are unchanged.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #177 keeps the validation contract unchanged while making existing tests portable across the four-platform quality matrix. Tests use native path helpers and deterministic spawn doubles; POSIX permission-bit checks remain required on non-Windows platforms, while byte preservation, immutability, hashing, and overwrite rejection remain required everywhere.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #182 adds a production-shaped protected-verifier regression in which the CLI canonical payload hash deliberately differs from the PostgreSQL `jsonb::text` hash. Passing proof must bind RLS live row to the approved plan in the CLI domain, exact unique valid primary `action_evidence` to the fresh snapshot in the database domain, and snapshot SHA to terminal completion. Missing, duplicate, foreign, wrong-action, false owner/state/JSON flags, malformed or unequal hashes, and snapshot/terminal drift must all remain fail-closed. Exact `src/**/*.ts` coverage remains 100%.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #184 keeps the validation contract unchanged for the dedicated 0.0.28 release. In addition to the existing exact-coverage and pre-push gates, release proof requires an unpublished-version check, absent-tag check, dry-run package inspection, a fresh four-platform matrix, AI Doc Lint, and Docpact with no diagnostics before merge.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #178 keeps the validation contract unchanged for the dedicated 0.0.27 release. In addition to the existing exact-coverage and pre-push gates, release proof requires an unpublished-version check, tag-name check, dry-run package inspection, a fresh four-platform matrix, and Docpact with no diagnostics before merge.

Review note, 2026-07-16: Issue #186 adds focused LCI/LCIA release proof for command dispatch, masked dry-runs, exact four-profile ZIP validation, signed-upload metadata binding, manager authorization error preservation, Calculation Bundle path allowlisting, atomic private outputs, overwrite refusal, and exact size/SHA-256 verification for every download. The full `src/**/*.ts` coverage requirement remains 100%, and no live mutation test may use a service-role credential.

Review note, 2026-07-17: Issue #191 keeps the validation contract unchanged while making two LCI/LCIA release permission assertions platform-appropriate. POSIX platforms retain the `0600` output-mode and unreachable-cleanup checks; Windows must pass the same functional, integrity, secrecy, full-coverage, and four-platform gates without pretending to enforce POSIX chmod semantics.

Review note, 2026-07-17: Issue #189 keeps the validation contract unchanged for the dedicated 0.0.29 release. In addition to the exact-coverage and pre-push gates, release proof requires unpublished-version and absent-tag checks, all four live CLI-version fixtures at 0.0.29, dry-run package inspection, AI Doc Lint, Docpact, and the release-time platform matrix before npm publication.

Review note, 2026-07-23: Issue #194 adds focused proof for ordered contract binding, stable action-ledger replay exclusion across copied contract/output paths, exact insert/update before-state checks, crash/orphan recovery, ambiguous transport readback, dependency isolation, owner/project mismatch, ledger corruption, and zero-dispatch parser/preflight failures. The same exact 100% `src/**/*.ts`, lint, build, docpact, and pre-push gates remain authoritative.

Review note, 2026-07-23: Issue #196 keeps the validation contract unchanged for the dedicated 0.0.30 release. The manually dispatched Windows gate is required to prove durable attempt/outcome ledger writes no longer fail on read-only-descriptor `fsync`; all execution-contract recovery/no-replay tests, all four live CLI-version fixtures, exact 100% coverage, dry-run package inspection, Docpact, tag/publish workflows, and exact npm provenance remain required.

Review note, 2026-07-23: Issue #198 adds a regression proving SDK validation cannot mutate the execution-contract input payload, its desired SHA, or the eventual dispatch target, and releases the repair as 0.0.31. Focused execution-contract coverage, all four live CLI-version fixtures, exact 100% coverage, Docpact, the full pre-push gate, the four-platform quality gate, package inspection, and exact npm provenance remain required.

Review note, 2026-07-24: Issue #200 releases 0.0.32 and adds focused proof for serial dependency-prefix completion, bounded suffix concurrency, stable report ordering, repeated-target rejection before DML, owner-token rollover, foreign renewed-session rejection at zero attempts, and unchanged success/UNKNOWN no-replay. Exact 100% coverage, Docpact, pre-push, four-platform quality, package inspection, and npm provenance gates remain required.

Review note, 2026-07-24: Issue #202 releases 0.0.33 and adds focused proof for flow delete-only admission, unique targets, complete RLS-visible process inbound scans, bounded concurrency, PREPARED-before-DISPATCHED durability, exact absent commit proof, lost-response recovery, success/UNKNOWN no-replay, independent-row continuation, and public/foreign/non-draft rejection. Exact 100% coverage, Docpact, pre-push, four-platform quality, package inspection, and npm provenance gates remain required.

Review note, 2026-07-24: Issue #204 adds a production-scale regression for the all-visible process fence: more than 250 visible rows must traverse offsets `0,250,...` with `limit=250`, no `user_id` predicate, exact-count completeness, and zero dispatch on scan or inbound-reference failure.

Review note, 2026-07-25: Issue #206 extends that regression to require the exact `id.asc,version.asc` primary-key order on every all-visible page while retaining the no-`user_id` and exact-count assertions. The test continues to prove that incomplete scans or inbound references dispatch zero mutations.

Review note, 2026-07-25: Issue #208 adds positive proof that a fresh exact-SHA all-process proof skips only the unfiltered live scan and still performs protected deletes, plus negative vectors for stale, foreign-project, foreign-actor, wrong-plan, wrong-target-binding, non-SELECT, nonzero-inbound, P0, chunk-gap, chunk-inbound, SHA-mismatch, incomplete-option, and wrong-mode evidence. Existing live-scan regressions remain required.

## Validation Matrix

| Change type | Minimum local proof | Additional proof when risk is higher | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bin/**`, `src/main.ts`, or `src/cli.ts` | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm build` | run the relevant `tiangong-lca --help` or subcommand help path after build | Launcher and dispatch changes affect the public command surface directly. |
| `src/auth-identity-receipt.ts`, `src/command-spec.ts`, `src/batch.ts`, `src/lib/batch/**`, declaration config, or public package exports | focused public primitive and architecture tests; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test:package`; `pnpm test:coverage`; `pnpm test:coverage:assert-full` | `pnpm prepush:gate`; run auth parser object-identity/fail-close, cross-process run-lock, infrastructure-drain, scale-operation, package ESM/CJS/TS, LOC/DAG/SCC, declaration, and byte-characterization proofs | Keep auth parsing a direct safe-projection re-export with no remote runner/internals; preserve exact CommandSpec authority and adapter cleanup, Node timer limits, guarded claim-time identity/content/policy/resource binding, immediate fatal claim closure plus settled worker drainage, mutation no-auto-retry, per-resource FIFO/min-ready-heap scheduling and event/claim order, successor exposure only after stop, per-result resume stop, one run-directory lock domain with live-scope drainage, internal-only ownership metadata, host-aware stale handling, bounded acyclic internals, and a closed package root/internal tree. |
| session, auth, env, or remote adapter helpers under `src/lib/{auth-*,dotenv,env,user-api-key,supabase-*,remote,http}*`, plus command-local remote adapters such as explicit identity-preflight hybrid search | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm build` | run focused tests for the touched helper plus one command that exercises the changed path | Record any required live env assumptions in the PR note. Identity receipt changes additionally require secret-leak scans, exact receipt parsing/hashing, and an intent-bound argv case; production read cases remain local and read-only. |
| flow, process, dataset, lifecyclemodel, review, publish, release, or run command families | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm build` | run focused tests for the touched command family; run `pnpm test:coverage:assert-full` if the change touched uncovered branches; prefer `pnpm prepush:gate` when the change adds new command paths | Preserve the low-entropy command contract and structured artifact outputs, including BuildPlan, review/dedup ruleset, publish schema, and verification gate reports when authoring or publish commands are involved. LCI/LCIA release proof must preserve manager-only mutation boundaries, exact four-ZIP upload identity/integrity, masked credentials, manifest-path selection, and byte/hash-verified atomic downloads. Dataset maintenance proof must also cover exact-count account pagination under server caps, plan immutability, current-user RLS/protected-row guards, drift rejection, approval-before-write, append-only action logs, stop/resume behavior, and fresh readback. Atomic alias work additionally requires exact closure, arbitrary-precision amounts, one RPC for the complete two-batch plan, and plan/batch/row/exchange proof-chain tests. Protected preparation additionally requires production-read-only freeze, offline byte-exact seal, canonical released-toolchain evidence, exact 23/27 derivative capture, and zero-write/zero-network separation. Derivative rebuild additionally requires single-action/component allowlists, action-scoped snapshots, guarded-RPC admission/replay, unchanged primary fields, and asynchronous terminal verification tests. |
| artifact, IO, or state-lock behavior | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm build` | run one representative command path that writes the changed artifact layout, if safe | Path and file layout regressions matter for downstream automation. |
| `test/**` or coverage gate scripts | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:coverage`; `pnpm test:coverage:assert-full` | run `pnpm prepush:gate` when the change affects the protected-branch gate directly | Coverage for `src/**/*.ts` is expected to remain at `100%`. |
| `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.nvmrc`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `scripts/ci/**`, or `.github/workflows/**` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm test:package`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm build` | run `pnpm prepush:gate`; run the four-platform `quality-gate` for release workflow changes; after a real publish run `pnpm release:verify-published -- --version <x.y.z> --expected-git-head <release-merge-sha>`; run `docpact lint` when the change affects release or documentation gates | Package-manager, TS7/Oxlint, release-tag, workflow, public-consumer, and dependency baselines change the repo contract. |
| governed docs only | `scripts/docpact validate-config --root . --strict`; `scripts/docpact lint --root . --staged --mode enforce` | run one focused route check, such as `command-surface`, `remote-session`, or `validation-release`, when the change touches routing or release docs | Refresh review metadata even when prose-only docs change. |

## Coverage Notes

Facts that matter:

- `pnpm --version` must be exactly `11.24.0`; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and the sole root `pnpm-lock.yaml` are the only dependency-resolution authorities
- Node must be exactly `24.19.0` for local/CI and package engines must be `>=24.19.0 <25`; TypeScript resolves only to `7.0.2`, and type-aware Oxlint is the only lint engine
- `pnpm test:package` verifies package-manager/TS7/Oxlint/CI contracts, inspects a clean tarball, and exercises a package-manager-neutral consumer
- public primitive proof must keep `@tiangong-lca/cli/auth-identity-receipt`, `@tiangong-lca/cli/command-spec`, `@tiangong-lca/cli/batch`, and `@tiangong-lca/cli/bin/tiangong-lca.js` importable from packed ESM/CJS/TS consumers without publishing Node typings or enabling package-root/deep imports
- `pnpm test:coverage` is the full coverage proof
- `pnpm test:coverage:assert-full` verifies the latest coverage artifact without rerunning coverage
- `pnpm prepush:gate` is the exact local test gate
- the local `pre-push` hook runs docpact first and then `pnpm prepush:gate`
- `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` supports manual exact-head reproduction and reusable invocation; its four exact matrix entries fail closed on actual `process.platform`/`process.arch`, and a detected CLI version change must pass them before tag creation
- every Node workflow bootstraps through pinned `pnpm/setup` v2.0.2 with Node 24.19.0 and installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; publishing uses native pnpm OIDC/provenance
- `pnpm release:verify-published -- --version <x.y.z> --expected-git-head <release-merge-sha>` is the post-publish cryptographic Sigstore/registry-signature/tarball/public-consumer gate; it fixes pnpm 11.24.0, replaces user/global package-manager configs, scans every production dependency branch, and passes no TianGong or registry credential into the clean consumer
- `process save-draft`, `lifecyclemodel save-draft`, ordered `dataset save-draft --execution-contract`, dataset governance commands such as curation queue build/next/verify, BuildPlan gates, publish schema/verification gates, and the newer process maintenance commands are expected to preserve `100%` coverage even when they add schema-validation, rewrite, recovery, or fallback branches
- dataset save-draft scheduler dogfood must leave the complete dependency prefix serial and keep `executeAction` as the only owner of durable attempt-before-dispatch, exact readback, UNKNOWN/no-replay, row reports, and report bytes; a generic batch failure may stop new suffix claims but cannot synthesize a command outcome
- LCI/LCIA release tests must cover all public actions and error branches without real credentials: user-session bootstrap is stubbed, remote error codes are preserved, upload request metadata is bound to local files, Calculation Bundle artifact selection is exact-path only, credentials stay masked, and no file becomes visible before size/hash verification succeeds. Live smoke tests, when explicitly authorized, use a disposable release identity and a real `data_product_manager` account through the public Edge/Database path; service-role or direct SQL evidence is invalid.
- Dataset maintenance tests must prove exact `id` + `version`, expected state, and current-account ownership are enforced; rows outside the explicitly authorized owner-draft alias profile remain protected; no action runs after full-plan drift or approval mismatch; approval is persisted before the first mutation; each attempted action is appended durably to `apply-progress.jsonl` with plan/action/mode correlation, actor, timing, before/after hashes, result/error, and rollback fields; and `verify` performs its own remote readback instead of trusting `apply` output.
- Exact-count pagination tests must prove that a requested page size such as 5000 still follows a 1000-row server cap with offsets `0,1000,2000...`; an exact multiple terminates without a speculative empty request; a true zero result accepts `*/0`; and missing/invalid/changing totals, early empty pages, range/body mismatch, page overflow, rows beyond total, missing/duplicate/out-of-order identities, foreign-owner rows, malformed/duplicate aggregate table proofs, or partial aggregate table sets fail closed. `plan`, apply preflight, and `verify` must not produce an accepted artifact or write after an incomplete scan. `clear-account` must execute zero deletes after an incomplete initial scan, re-read all five tables at the end, require aggregate `row_count=0` for success, and retain a failure audit if the final proof cannot complete after mutation starts. The evidence proves pagination completeness under stable filtered membership/order, not transaction-level/MVCC snapshot isolation.
- Alias-plan tests must prove exact ordered `time`/`length_time` and `target_mode=owner_draft` binding; factors `0.00011415525114155251`/`1000` without binary floating point; 52 row and 59 exchange identities; embedded UUID/version preservation; 309 unrelated exchanges unchanged; source-reference zeroing and fixed target postconditions; exactly one `target_visibility=owner_draft` `cmd_dataset_alias_plan_guarded` call; rollback of the first 25 rows when the second dimension fails; whole-plan lost-response replay; rejection of public/foreign/mixed/stale or 25-row partial state; and rejection of numeric, foreign, duplicate, or mismatched plan/batch/row audit ids. CLI accepts audit ids only as positive-integer strings so PostgreSQL bigint values cannot lose precision in JavaScript. Verify validates returned plan and nested batch proofs with their local correlation, but does not independently query `public.command_audit_log`; the guarded RPC remains responsible for audit-row creation and replay proof.
- Derivative-rebuild tests must prove `operation=rebuild-derivatives` and `action=rebuild_derivatives` are bidirectionally bound; V1 accepts exactly one exact-version `processes` row with current owner, `state_code=0`, `target_mode=owner_draft`, and exactly `extracted_md` plus `embedding_ft`. They must reject zero/multiple actions, other tables/components, public/foreign/non-draft rows, malformed snapshots, and pre-apply drift. Plan tests must prove the action-scoped database snapshot is included without adding large derivative columns to the account-wide scan. Apply tests must prove exactly one guarded-RPC admission, durable `accepted`/`queued` reporting, idempotent lost-response replay with the same request identity, and no direct Edge, `admin embedding-run`, raw queue, SQL, service-role, or raw REST mutation path. Approval alone must not skip the exact just-in-time preflight; only a valid immutable `derivative-admission-attempt.json`, created immediately before transport and bound to the same plan/action/snapshot/actor, may enable lost-response recovery. Tests must also prove the ordinary sequential executor rejects derivative and unsupported actions before any mutation transport. Verify tests must cover `pending`, `passed`, and `failed`, require both requested derivatives to be current, and fail if any frozen primary precondition changes; an apply admission report alone can never pass verification.
- Protected alias-runner tests must prove commit/status-only mutual exclusion; production project and exact actor/plan/freeze/approval/target-set/baseline bindings; no full rescan after server preflight; three ordered server-derived gates within 180 seconds; immutable per-attempt artifacts; one admission POST maximum; no automatic retry, restart replay, Dev replay, generic apply, or legacy-RPC fallback; read-only recovery for timeout, cancellation, lost response, and transient status-read failures; immutable first terminal evidence; and later-live-drift reporting without canonical overwrite. Contract tests must accept exact zero-child `not_started` derivative evidence only for active pre-dispatch states or terminal `failed`/`indeterminate`, while rejecting it for `completed` and `derivatives_pending`. Terminal verification must require exact 52 rows, 59 exchanges, 55 audits, 50 unique targets with a 23/27 table split, causal Markdown/embedding proof, and independent live RLS snapshot equality.
- Protected preparation tests must prove `freeze-protected` performs complete account/support/projected-reference checks and exactly 50 derivative snapshot reads in stable 23-flow + 27-process order while making zero preflight, gate, admission, execution, or mutation calls. Every derivative snapshot must match the immediately preceding census row identity, owner, state, and `modified_at`; concurrent primary drift must fail before freeze artifacts. Tests must reject non-production project evidence, mismatched running CLI/package evidence, malformed or non-canonical toolchain/freeze/request files, public/foreign/non-draft targets, duplicate or incomplete targets, and each superseded historical plan SHA-256. `seal-protected-approval` must receive no environment, session, HTTP, or remote adapter; tests must prove raw-byte hashing, fatal invalid-UTF-8 rejection, exact whitespace/final-newline preservation, explicit freeze-file/request/text/account/timestamp guards, immutable artifacts, and unchanged acceptance by the existing protected runner/parser and production approval-identity algorithm. The canonical `approved_at_utc` must be present in the pre-review request hash/text, and resealing with any other timestamp must fail.
- Live maintenance validation, when explicitly authorized, must use a disposable current-user draft scope and the official platform command path. Direct SQL, service-role credentials, or raw REST mutation are never acceptable test evidence.
- release-tag and docpact lint workflow changes should be described in the PR note when they alter the local or protected-branch proof
- `tag-release-from-merge.yml` is idempotent when the expected `cli-v*` tag already points at the merge commit, and `publish.yml` can be re-run with `workflow_dispatch` only for an existing `cli-v*` tag on `origin/main`
- local npm authentication is not release validation evidence; routine publication is verified by the upstream tag workflow and npm Trusted Publishing workflow after merge

If the task changes control flow, add or update tests instead of using coverage-ignore pragmas.

## Minimum PR Note Quality

A good PR note for this repo should say:

1. which commands ran
2. which focused tests or help paths were exercised when the change touched one command family
3. whether the full protected-branch gate was run or deferred

## Local Docpact Push Gate

Install the versioned local hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The `pre-push` hook runs `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, which delegates CLI lookup to `scripts/docpact` and performs strict config validation plus enforced lint before the push leaves the machine. It then runs `pnpm prepush:gate` as the local test gate, including `pnpm test:package` and exact 100% source coverage. The wrapper checks `DOCPACT_BIN`, Cargo install locations, Homebrew install locations, and then `PATH`, so local agent shells should not fail only because bare `docpact` is unavailable. The default comparison base is `origin/main`. Override it for unusual stacks with `DOCPACT_BASE_REF=<ref>` or `scripts/docpact-gate.sh --base <ref>`. The gate writes its detailed report to a temporary file so normal pushes do not create `.docpact/runs/` artifacts.
